# Build the docs site on Vercel using Nix.
#
# Vercel's build image is fixed (Amazon Linux 2023) and can't be swapped for a
# Nix image, so we install Nix into it and build the same .#docs derivation
# that CI verifies. The build runs as root in an ephemeral container, so we do
# a single-user install with the nixbld build-users group disabled. cache.nixos.org
# supplies almost everything prebuilt, so a cold build is seconds, not minutes.
#
# Vercel runs installCommand and buildCommand as separate shells, so this
# script does both in one place and vercel.json calls it as the buildCommand.
set -euo pipefail

# Pin the Nix installer to an immutable, versioned release rather than the
# rolling nixos.org/nix/install redirect, and verify its SHA-256 before
# running it, so a swapped artifact or a MITM can't get code execution here.
# This script embeds and checks the per-arch tarball hashes itself, so pinning
# it pins the whole install. Bump both together when upgrading Nix:
#   curl -fsSL https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-<ver>/install | sha256sum

# Nix's single-user installer and git both need a few tools the base image
# doesn't ship. --skip-broken sidesteps the curl-minimal/curl conflict.

# Vercel's Amazon Linux 2023 build image doesn't provide /dev/fd, which bash
# process substitution (< <(...)) needs. patchelf's setup-hook uses it during
# the fixup phase of any derivation containing ELF files — e.g. the fetchNpmDeps
# FOD, whose npm cache includes native bindings like lightningcss. Without this
# symlink, patchelf fails with "/dev/fd/63: No such file or directory" and the
# entire docs build cascades to failure. See:
#   https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/build-support/patchelf/setup-hook.sh

# The docs content lives in the modelplane/ submodule. Vercel checks submodules
# out itself when the project has "Include submodules" enabled and the submodule
# URL is public, but init it here too so a build doesn't silently produce an
# empty site.
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build the site. result is a symlink into the read-only store; dereference it
# into a plain, writable directory Vercel can serve.
#
# The flake ref is path:. rather than the usual '.?submodules=1': path: copies
# the working tree as-is, submodule contents included, and doesn't need the
# checkout to be a git repo. Locally and in CI, use '.?submodules=1' instead -
# it filters to git-tracked files, so an untracked node_modules or public/ in
# the working tree stays out of the build.
#
# The main project's production build uses the canonical https://docs.modelplane.ai/
# baseURL baked into nix/docs.nix: a pure, cached build identical to what CI verifies.
#
# Release branch projects (e.g. release-0.1) set HUGO_BASEURL in their Vercel
# environment variables (e.g. https://v0-1.docs.modelplane.ai/) so their output
# resolves assets and links against the correct subdomain.
# --impure lets the derivation read HUGO_BASEURL from the environment.
#
# Previews use a root-relative ("/") baseURL. A preview is reachable on several
# hostnames (the per-deployment URL and the branch alias) and sits behind Vercel
# Deployment Protection, so an absolute baseURL baked to one host breaks the page
# when viewed on another: the cross-host request for the stylesheet/JS hits the
# auth wall and returns HTML instead of the asset, leaving the page unstyled.
# Root-relative URLs resolve against whatever host serves the page.
